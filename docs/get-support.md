To learn more or for non-urgent questions:

- **OCTO Slack:** [#ves-event-bus][slack-#ves-event-bus] in the Office of CTO @VA workspace
- **Email:** OITEnterpriseEventBus@va.gov

**Best Practice:** Please use the public channel rather than direct messaging team members. This helps others learn from shared questions and answers.

## **Support Hours**

- **Slack Support Hours:** Monday - Friday, 12pm - 5pm ET (excluding federal holidays)
- **Note:** Engineers often respond by 9am ET if they're in Eastern or Central timezones
- **24/7 Support:** Available for urgent incidents via PagerDuty email which can be found on OCTO Slack [#event-bus-support][slack-#event-bus-support]  (Must email from a @va.gov address. If you do not have a @va.gov email address, see below.)

## **Reporting Urgent Incidents**

When you need immediate assistance with a critical operational, security, or privacy incident:

1. Check the [#event-bus-support][slack-#event-bus-support] OCTO Slack channel first
2. Email the PagerDuty email **from a @va.gov email address**
   - This will alert the on-call engineer's mobile device 24/7
   - Response expected within 30 minutes in the [#event-bus-support][slack-#event-bus-support] OCTO Slack Channel

**Include in your email:**

- Is this a security or privacy incident? (Yes/No)
- Which environment is impacted? (Sandbox/Production)
- Brief description of the incident's impact

## **Using Non-VA Email Addresses**

If you need to use a non @va.gov email address to contact the on-call engineer:

1. Send a message to the [#event-bus-support][slack-#event-bus-support] OCTO Slack channel
2. Request your email address or domain be added to the "allowed list"
3. Explain your specific need for using a non-VA email address
