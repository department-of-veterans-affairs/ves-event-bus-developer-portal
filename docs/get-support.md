# Get Support

The best way to request support from the Event Bus Team is to reach out to us via the [#ves-event-bus Slack channel (must be in the Office of CTO @VA workspace)](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C042ZQ7JUAX).

Please avoid direct messaging an Event Bus team member in Slack. Chatting openly in the channel allows others to learn from the questions and answers discussed.

## Slack channel support hours 

Event Bus Slack channel support hours are from 9am - 5pm ET, Monday through Friday, with the exception of federal holidays.

Response times are based on the nature of the posting:

* Incidents (outage or error): ASAP. Please clearly indicate this is an “INCIDENT” in the post.
* General inquiries: 2-3 hours.

## Slack service notifications

Alerts about Event Bus monitoring can be found on the following Slack channels:

* [#ves-event-bus-prod-alerts (must be in the Office of CTO @VA workspace)](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C06N7QKMQN4)
