# **Get Support**

## **Report an incident**

To report a security or privacy incident, or an urgent critical operational incident requiring immediate support, check the [#event-bus-support Slack channel][slack-#event-bus-support] Topic for our PagerDuty email address. Sending an email to this PagerDuty address will generate a notification to the on-call engineer's mobile device 24/7 as long as the email was sent from a @va.gov email address.  You can expect a response within 30 minutes in the [#event-bus-support Slack channel][slack-#event-bus-support] in the Office of CTO @VA workspace.

If you prefer to use a non @va.gov email address to trigger notifications to the on-call engineer's mobile device, you can request a specific email address, or workplace email domain, be added to an "allowed list". To initiate this request, send a message explaining your need to the [#event-bus-support Slack channel][slack-#event-bus-support] and the appropriate personnel will reach out to you.

Please include the following information in your email:

* Is this a security or privacy incident? Yes/No
* Which environment is impacted? Sandbox/Production
* Briefly, what is the impact of the incident?

## **General support requests**

For non-urgent support requests, the best way to request support from the Event Bus Team is to reach out to us via the [#event-bus-support Slack channel][slack-#event-bus-support] in the Office of CTO @VA workspace.

Please avoid direct messaging an Event Bus team member in Slack. Chatting openly in the channel allows others to learn from the questions and answers discussed.

Event Bus Slack channel support hours are from 12pm - 5pm ET, Monday through Friday, with the exception of federal holidays. Often, an engineer will respond by 9am ET if they live in the Eastern or Central timezones. You can expect a response within 1 hour during the support hours.


## **Slack service notifications**

Alerts and warnings from Event Bus monitoring can be found in the following Slack channels:


* [#ves-event-bus-sandbox-alerts (must be in the Office of CTO @VA workspace)][slack-#ves-event-bus-sandbox-alerts]
* [#ves-event-bus-prod-alerts (must be in the Office of CTO @VA workspace)][slack-#ves-event-bus-prod-alerts]
