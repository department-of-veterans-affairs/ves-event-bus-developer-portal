## Get Event Bus Support

The best way to request support from the Event Bus Team is to reach out to us via the [#ves-event-bus](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C042ZQ7JUAX) Slack channel in the Digital Service VA workspace.

Please avoid direct messaging an Event Bus team member in Slack. Chatting openly in the [#ves-event-bus](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C042ZQ7JUAX) channel allows others to learn from the questions and answers discussed.

## Slack Channel Support Hours 
Event Bus Slack channel support hours are from 9am - 5pm ET, Monday through Friday, with the exception of Federal holidays.

Response times are based on the nature of the posting:

- Incidents (outage or error): ASAP. Please clearly indicate this is an “INCIDENT” in the post.
- General inquiries: 2-3 hours.

## Slack Service Notifications
Slack channels for Event Bus alerts and monitoring are the following:
- [#ves-event-bus-dev](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04PART9C05)
- (Additional channels may be created, as needed)
