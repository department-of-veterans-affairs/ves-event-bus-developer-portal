# Get Support

## General support requests

The best way to request support from the Event Bus Team is to reach out to us via the [#event-bus-support][slack-#event-bus-support] Slack channel in the Office of CTO @VA workspace.

Please avoid direct messaging an Event Bus team member in Slack. Chatting openly in the [#event-bus-support][slack-#event-bus-support] channel allows others to learn from the questions and answers discussed.

Event Bus Slack channel support hours are from 12pm - 5pm ET, Monday through Friday, with the exception of federal holidays. Often, an engineer will respond by 9am ET if they live in the Eastern or Central timezones. You can expect a response within 1 hour during the support hours.

## Report an incident

To report a security or privacy incident, or an urgent critical operational incident email event-bus@veterans-affairs.pagerduty.com. This will generate a page to the on-call engineer's mobile device 24/7. You can expect a response within 30 minutes.

Please include the following information in your email:

* Is this a security or privacy incident? Yes/No
* Which environment is impacted? Sandbox/Production
* Briefly, what is the impact of the incident?

## Slack service notifications
