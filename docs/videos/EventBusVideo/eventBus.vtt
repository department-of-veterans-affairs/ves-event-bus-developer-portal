Hi, I'm Logan Mitchell, an Engineer on the Event Bus Team, and today I'm going to guide you through the Enterprise Event Bus.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.100
What is the Event Bus?

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.200
Event Bus is an event processing system that offers asynchronous and real-time event data transfer between systems within the VA. 

4
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
Then, you might ask, what is an event?

5
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.200
An event in this context is data describing something that took place in a VA system.

6
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500
Any data that would be useful to share between systems as soon it's available could be packaged into an event.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.600
Examples of things that could be events include:

8
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.700
medical claim processing information, contact center ticket information, or Veteran personal data updates. 

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.900
Currently, many VA systems poll for data infrequently, and between many layers of systems. 

10
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.200
This means an update to one system may take days or months to be updated in all locations, as the data is slowly requested by each system from another on their own schedules. 

11
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.100
Not only that, but not all systems are connected or get data from the same source; something that is updated in one place may not ever reach other systems.

12
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.000
Event Bus offers a solution to these problems. 

13
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:29.000
By providing a system that reads from sources and offers the data in a specialized output stream in real-time, client systems can stay connected and receive data as it is available.

14
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.400
This reduces the need for slow, inter-system polling and one-to-one connections between many dependent systems. 

15
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.600
If a Veteran updates their address in one source, it can be fed into Event Bus and all systems can be notified at once, as it happens. 

16
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.200
No more slow propagation and compiling data from many other systems!

17
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.100
Event Bus also offers further advantages.

18
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:08.500
By using an event streaming platform called Kafka and providing a high-uptime single source of data, Event Bus sidesteps some of the reliability issues other systems have. 

19
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.700
Kafka temporarily keeps all events in its output stream and also tracks which event each client last consumed.

20
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.500
If there is any interruption in the connection, the client can resume reading from the data stream as soon as they reconnect, right where they left off.

21
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.200
In addition, Event Bus is a centralized hub for events, reducing intersystem dependencies and the number of intersystem connections needed.

22
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.200
With Event Bus acting as the Data Hub, systems don't need to be so tightly coupled!

23
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:47.000
As of August 2024, Event Bus is fully deployed as a production service on the Lighthouse Delivery Infrastructure (LHDI) platform. 

24
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:57.300
We currently have a Decision Letter Availability event available, and the Benefits Management Tools team is working on an app to consume that event to trigger an email notification to Veterans. 

25
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.900
We are also working with the VA Profile team to add a Military Service event to the bus and are actively pursuing additional producer and consumer integrations.

26
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.000
