00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:7.200
Let's take a look at Event Bus in action, using a visual demo to help see how the data flows through the system.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.700
Here we have a representation of our source data; in this case a medical claims processing event coming from a VA system.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.700
Our Veteran, Mark, selected here... 

4
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.400
...has just had a medical procedure, and the event indicating that a claim has been processed for this procedure is about to be available.

5
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.700
The data in this event includes relevant information that can help Mark if other VA systems know about it.

6
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:42.800
In a real situation, the medical data comes pre-defined from the provider, but for the purposes of this demo we can choose what data is included in the medical event.

7
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.500
We'll select that the event requires a new prescription...

8
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.300
...and that the health update was important and Mark should get an SMS update about it.

9
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.900
Now let's trigger that medical processing event!

10
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.000
Now that we've triggered the event, it is made available to Event Bus, which picks it up immediately.

11
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.500
Event Bus reads the event and sends pieces of the event data to specialized channels in real time,

12
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:13.100
demonstrating one way the Event Bus could be used to give clients only the data they need from a source stream.

13
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.000
Event Bus can also be used for simpler streams; in our existing use cases, events are simply passed from a source to a single specialized topic.

14
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.800
The first channel is read by a system that informs Mark's local VA office about medical claim events.

15
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.300
Now the office is aware the medical event happened for followup appointments and additional treatment.

16
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.800
The second channel is read by a system that Mark's pharmacy uses to check for new prescriptions.

17
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.000
Now as soon as the event indicates a new prescription is ready, Mark can verify and pick up his prescription.

18
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.300
The third channel is read by a system that sends SMS notifications to Veterans.

19
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.000
Since this was an important processed claim, Mark is notified that his followup appointment with his VA clinic can be scheduled.

20
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.900
With these various systems connected to the Event Bus, VA was able to automate processes that resulted in providing faster service and more proactive communication with Mark.

21
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.200
In today's systems, he may have waited days to hear about the processing, if he ever heard at all.

22
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.500
That's the power of Event Bus!
