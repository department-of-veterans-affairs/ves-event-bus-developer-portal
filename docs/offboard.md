# **Offboarding**

If your team intends to offboard from the Enterprise Event Bus, please begin by informing the Event Bus team as early as possible. We aim to have at least six monthsâ€™ notice so that we can coordinate with all impacted parties, including the producers or consumers of your deprecated event. 

Please [contact us](./get-support.md) if you'd like to offboard from a specific event, or from the Event Bus altogether.
