# Offboarding

If your team intends to offboard from the Enterprise Event Bus, please begin by informing the Event Bus team as early as possible. We aim to have at least six monthsâ€™ notice so that we can coordinate with all impacted parties, including the producers or consumers of your deprecated event. 

Please [contact us](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/ves-event-bus-developer-portal/get-support/) if you'd like to offboard from a specific event, or from the Event Bus altogether.
